# Contribution Guidelines and Terms

When working with the NearbyWeather Project, please make sure that:

- You are working with the latest publicly available versions of Xcode and Swift. If you do not observe this, you may run into compatibility issues, when cloning the project.

- You use standard indentation and formatting settings inside Xcode. If your pull request makes changes to lines due to formatting with no actual code modification, it won't be considered until fixed.

- Your code complies with the clean code style guide by Ray Wenderlich.

- When submitting your pull request, make sure it is properly labeled. Work in progress is marked via "Do Not Merge Yet". Once you would like your code to be checked, label the pull request using "Ready for Review". Only requests that have this label will be looked at.

Your contributions are submitted under the following terms:

- Your code submission is subject to the MIT License and can be used, reused, amended or changed at the project author's or other contributors' discretion.

Thank you for taking part in the open source collaboration!
